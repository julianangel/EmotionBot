This arduino code is for ArduinoDue.
This new version of the code has been done object oriented.

Libraries developed:
*Triskar: has all the methods to controll the triskar platform as: kinematics.
*MC33887: has all the methods to controll the motors. it has all the commands and signals to correctly controll this kind of motors. 
*TheatreBotSmall: is the new part in this version. It contains the following classes:
	-TheatrePlatfrom: is the controll for the bottom part of the platform, in the theatrebot case it has three motors. It does not have any control of the upper part.
	-TheatreRobotSmall: is the connection between the bottom part and upper part. It also has all the controller
	-TheatreUpperPart: is the controll for the upper part.
	-DCMotor: is the class that has all the PID controller for a motor

Dependencies:
*DueTimer
*Encoder
*PID

There are problems with the libraries exported from rosserial_arduino with this platform. The error is the followin:
error: cannot convert 'USARTClass*' to 'UARTClass*' in assignment iostream = &Serial1;
